# Pre-liquidation Contract Formal Verification

This folder contains the
[CVL](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/cvl/index.html)
specification and verification setup for the
[pre-liquidation](../src/PreLiquidation.sol) contract using the
[Certora Prover](https://www.certora.com/).

## Getting Started

This project depends on two different versions of
[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) which are required for running
the verification. The compiler binaries should be available under the
following path names:

  - `solc-0.8.19` for the solidity compiler version `0.8.19`, which is
    used for `MorphoBlue`;
  - `solc-0.8.27` for the solidity compiler version `0.8.27`, which is
    used for `PreLiquidation`.

The verification is performed on modified source files, which can be
generated by running the following command.

``` shell
make -C certora munged
```

### Installing the Certora Prover

The Certora CLI can be installed by running `python3 -m pip3 install
certora-cli`. Detailed installation instructions can be found on
Certora's official
[documentation](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/install.html).

To verifying a specification, run the command `certoraRun Spec.conf`
where `Spec.conf` is the configuration file of the matching CVL
specification. Configuration files are available in
[`certora/conf`](./confs). Please ensure that `CERTORA_KEY` is set up
in your environment.

## Overview

The PreLiquidation contract enables Morpho Blue borrowers to set up a
safer liquidation plan on a given position, thus preventing undesired
liquidations.
